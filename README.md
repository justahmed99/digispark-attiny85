# digispark-attiny85
This repository is an example of Digispark Attiny85 payloads that I made

This is repository is consisted of DigiSpark Attiny85 payloads that I made of my learning purpose. I share this codes so people can use for learning or academic aims.

DigiSpark Attiny85 is a wonderful board. It can performs as HID (Human Interface Device) such as keyboard and mouse.

To use these scripts you need to install DigiStump boards in your Arduino IDE by adding this :

in your Arduino IDE preference.

Also you need to install the driver from https://github.com/digistump/DigistumpArduino/releases.
